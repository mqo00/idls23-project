The second test case might have a different structure or length than the first one, causing your code to fail to generalize to different inputs.\n\n2. There might be a bug in your code that only manifests itself for certain inputs. You can try to print out intermediate results and compare them with the expected output to identify where the bug might be.\n\n3. Your beam size might be too small for the second test case, causing the algorithm to miss the optimal path. You can try increasing the beam size and see if that improves the results.\n\nI would recommend going through your code step by step and comparing it with the pseudocode to make sure that you are implementing the algorithm correctly. Additionally, you can try to run your code on other inputs to see if it produces the expected output. If you are still having trouble, feel free to ask for help during office hours or on Piazza."

It's not uncommon for the first test case to pass but the second one to fail, as the second test case may have different edge cases or requirements that your implementation may not be handling correctly.\n\nWithout seeing your code or the specific test cases, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what might be going wrong. However, some common issues with beam search implementations include:\n\n1. Incorrectly updating the beam: Make sure that you're correctly updating the beam at each step of the search, and that you're only keeping the top-k paths based on their scores.\n\n2. Incorrectly handling duplicate paths: If your implementation is generating duplicate paths, this can cause issues with the beam search. Make sure that you're properly handling duplicate paths and not adding them to the beam.\n\n3. Incorrectly handling end-of-sequence tokens: If your implementation is not properly handling end-of-sequence tokens, this can cause issues with the beam search. Make sure that you're correctly terminating paths when they reach the end-of-sequence token.\n\nI hope this helps! If you're still having trouble, feel free to bring your code to office hours or post a follow-up question on Piazza with more details about your implementation and the specific test cases that are failing."

However, here are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Check your code for bugs: Make sure that your code is correctly implemented and that there are no syntax errors or logical mistakes. Double-check your calculations and make sure that you are using the correct variables and functions.\n\n2. Check your data: Make sure that you are using the correct data for the validation and test sets. Check that the data is correctly formatted and that there are no missing values or outliers.\n\n3. Check your hyperparameters: Make sure that you are using the correct hyperparameters for your model. Try adjusting the learning rate, batch size, or number of epochs to see if this improves your results.\n\n4. Use cross-validation: Cross-validation can help you get a better estimate of your model's performance. Try using k-fold cross-validation to see if your results are consistent across different folds.\n\n5. Seek help: If you are still having trouble, don't hesitate to ask for help. Reach out to your instructor or TA, or post a question on the course forum or Piazza."
